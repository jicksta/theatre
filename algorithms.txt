Running average without history

Variables:

current_average = current average of all numbers in data set
          count = count of things in current average
reduced_average = current average adjusted for one more number to be added to the data set
           data = new item for the dataset
    new_average = new average of all numbers in data set, including "data"


  count / (count+1) = current_average / reduced_average
âˆ´   reduced_average = (current_average * (count + 1)) / count

        new_average = reduced_average + (data / (count + 1))
